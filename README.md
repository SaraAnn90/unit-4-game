# unit-4-game
This is the Crystal Collector game I created for my jQuery project. It consists of HTML, CSS, Images, Javascript, and jQuery. The user
clicks each different crystal in order to try and match their number with the number generated by the computer. If the user number is equal to the computer number, the user increases their wins by one. If the user number is greater than the computer number, the user increases their losses by one.
